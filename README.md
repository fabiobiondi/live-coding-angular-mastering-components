A long session of live coding to explain several topics and techniques to create custom reusable components:

* Input, Output and Content Projection
* Composite components
* Component lifecycle
* `@ViewChildren` vs `@ContentChildren`
* 3rd party integration
* Create custom errors
* Integration with HTML Canvas

* Grid Layout Component
* Chart Component (with Chart.js)
* Google Map Component (with static API)

### BASED on Angular CLI

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
